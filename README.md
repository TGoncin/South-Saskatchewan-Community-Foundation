Summarized project background & business need/opportunity:

Creating a more efficient and easier to use site that is designed to handle all of the South-SK Community Foundation's donor and donor beneficiaries. 


_____________________________________________________________________

Northstar & carryover customers:

Our northstar is oriented around donors (tend to be older people; 40+ years of age) and it comes down to all business owners, foundation owners, donor beneficiaries, etc.
Everyone else is a carryover customer since if someone of old age can use it than someone of young age theoretically can.

Project assumptions : (e.g. WordPress):

- We assume WordPress can handle our Figma design
- We assume we will be able to become sufficent enough in WordPress to create the desired objective (Within given time-frame)
- We assume, because of the response of the Team Meeting that she uses another partner for the request form/ email services



_____________________________________________________________________

Project constraints : (beyond time - we're all busy - what are the "real" constraints here folks):

- Proficient enough (Within time-frame) in WordPress to create the desired objective
- WordPress contains the capabilities to produce our vision
- Team availability
- Sufficient client feedback
